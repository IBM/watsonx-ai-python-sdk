Cloud Pak for Data
==================

Requirements
------------
Starting work with IBM Cloud Pak for Data refer to `Getting started` section in main product documentation:
 - Version 4.8

Supported machine learning frameworks
-------------------------------------
For the list of supported machine learning frameworks (models) of IBM Cloud Pak® for Data, refer to `watsonx.ai Documentation`:
 - Version 4.8

Authentication
--------------
If you are a user of IBM Cloud Pak® for Data version 4.8, you can create an IBM watsonx.ai Python client by providing credentials, or using a token:

**Note:** To determine <URL> and <APIKEY> refer to `Authentication <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/4.8?topic=functions-authentication-watson-machine-learning>`__
section of product documentation.

Example of creating the client using credentials (`username`/`password`):

.. code-block:: python

    from ibm_watsonx_ai import APIClient
    wml_credentials = {
                       "url": "<URL>",
                       "username": "<USERNAME>",
                       "password" : "<PASSWORD>",
                       "instance_id": "openshift",
                       "version" : "4.8"
                      }

    client = APIClient(wml_credentials)

Example of creating the client using credentials (`username`/`apikey`):

.. code-block:: python

    from ibm_watsonx_ai import APIClient
    wml_credentials = {
                       "url": "<URL>",
                       "username": "<USERNAME>",
                       "apikey" : "<APIKEY>",
                       "instance_id": "openshift",
                       "version" : "4.8"
                      }

    client = APIClient(wml_credentials)

Example of creating the client using a token:

In IBM Cloud Pak® for Data version 4.8, user can authenticate with token set in the notebook environment.

.. code-block:: python

    access_token = os.environ['USER_ACCESS_TOKEN']
    from ibm_watsonx_ai import APIClient

    wml_credentials = {
                       "url": "<URL>",
                       "token": access_token,
                       "instance_id": "openshift"
                       "version" : "4.8"
                      }
    client = APIClient(wml_credentials)

**Note:**
      * The version value should be set to version and release (format: `x.y`, for example: `4.8`)
        for In IBM Cloud Pak® for Data users.
      * Setting default space id or project id is mandatory. For examples, refer to ``client.set.default_space()`` and ``client.set.default_project()`` APIs in this document.

**Note for IBM Cloud Pak® for Data version 4.8 and above:**
    If during authentication the following error appear:

    .. code-block::

        Attempt of generating `bedrock_url` automatically failed.
        If iamintegration=True, please provide `bedrock_url` in wml_credentials.
        If iamintegration=False, please validate your credentials.

    There are two possible causes:

    1. During installation were chosen option: iamintegration=False (default configuration). Probably the credentials are invalid or service is temporary unavailable.
    2. During installation were chosen option: iamintegration=True. Autogeneration of `bedrock_url` wasn't successful.
       In this situation IBM Cloud Pak foundational services URL should be provided as `bedrock_url` param to the wml_credentials.

       To get IBM Cloud Pak foundational services URL please refer to documentation: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/4.8?topic=overview-authentication#find_bedrock
